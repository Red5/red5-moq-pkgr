Abstract

   This protocol can be used to send and receive video and audio over
   Media over QUIC Transport [MOQT], using LOC[loc] packaging.

   This document is a local working copy of draft-cenzano-moq-media-
   interop-03 with HEVC/H.265 (Video H265 in HVCC) extensions added
   by the red5-moq-pkgr project.  The base specification defines media
   types 0x00-0x03.  This document adds media type 0x04 and header
   extension types 0x17 and 0x19 for HEVC support.

1.  Introduction

   This protocol specifies a simple mechanism for sending media (video
   and audio) over LOC[loc] for both live-streaming and video conference
   (VC) style use cases.

   moq-mi allows updating encoding parameters in the middle of a track
   (ex: frame rate, resolution, codec, etc)

   The protocol refers to [loc] to define the specific media wire
   format.

2.  Protocol Operation

2.1.  Track Names

   The publisher selects a namespace of their choosing, and sends an
   ANNOUNCE message for this namespace.

   Within the publisher namespace the publisher will offer media tracks
   named as videoX and audioX where X will be an integer starting at 0.

   So in case the publisher issues 2 audio tracks and 1 video track, the
   track names available will be video0, audio0, and audio1.

   The subscriber will consider all of those tracks belonging to the
   same namespace as part of the same synchronization group (timestamps
   aligned to the same timeline).

2.2.  Mapping Tracks to MoQT Object Model

   For the video track, the publisher begins a new group at the start of
   each IDR (so object 0 will be always an IDR Keyframe), and each group
   contains a single subgroup.  Each object has the format described in
   Section 2.4.  This applies to both H.264 and H.265 video tracks.

   For HEVC/H.265, the same group/object mapping applies.  A new group
   begins at each IDR or CRA (Clean Random Access) picture, and object 0
   within each group is always a random access point.

   For the audio track, the publisher begins a new group with each audio
   object, and each group contains a single subgroup.  Each object has
   the format described in Section 2.4.

   TODO: Datagram forwarding preference could be used, but has problems
   if audio frame does not fit in a single UDP payload.

2.3.  Timestamps

   To avoid using fractional numbers and having to deal with rounding
   errors, timestamps will be expressed with two integers: - timestamp
   numerator (ex: PTS, DTS, duration) - timebase

   To convert a timestamp into seconds you just need to: timestamp(s) =
   timestamp numerator / timebase

   Example:

   PTS = 11, timebase = 30

   PTS(s) = 11/30 = 0.366666s

2.4.  Object Format

   MoQ-MI uses MOQT extension headers to provide metadata that
   identifies and augemts the media information found in the object
   payload.

2.4.1.  Media type header extension (header extension type = 0x0A)

   It defines the media type inside object payload (see section IANA in
   MOQ TODO), and it MUST be present in all objects

                  +=======+============================+
                  | Value | Media type                 |
                  +=======+============================+
                  |   0x0 | Video H264 in AVCC         |
                  +-------+----------------------------+
                  |   0x1 | Audio Opus bitsream        |
                  +-------+----------------------------+
                  |   0x2 | UTF-8 text                 |
                  +-------+----------------------------+
                  |   0x3 | Audio AAC-LC in MPEG4      |
                  +-------+----------------------------+
                  |   0x4 | Video H265 in HVCC         |
                  +-------+----------------------------+

        type = 0x19)

   Provides extradata (decoder configuration) needed to start decoding
   the H.265/HEVC video stream.

   It MUST be present in object 0 (start of group) where "media type
   header extension" is equal to "Video H265 in HVCC"(0x4) AND there has
   been an update on the encoding parameters (or very start of the

   This MUST be HEVCDecoderConfigurationRecord as described in
   [ISO14496-15] section 8.3.3.1.2, with field lengthSizeMinusOne = 3
   (So length = 4).  If any other size length is indicated (in
   HEVCDecoderConfigurationRecord) we should error with "Protocol
   violation".

   The HEVCDecoderConfigurationRecord contains the VPS, SPS, and PPS
   NAL units required to initialize the HEVC decoder.

4.  Payloads

   TODO: This sections needs to be updated with links to LOC

4.1.  For object header media type = Video H264 in AVCC (0x00)

   Payload MUST be H264 with bitstream AVC1 format as described in
   [ISO14496-15:2019] section 5.3.  Using 4 bytes size field length.

4.2.  For object header media type = Audio Opus bitsream (0x01)

   Payload MUST be Opus packets, as described in [RFC6716] - section 3

4.3.  For object header media type = UTF-8 text (0x02)

   Payload MUST be text bytes in UTF-8, as described in [RFC3629]

4.4.  For object header media type = Audio AAC-LC in MPEG4 (0x03)

   Payload MUST be AAC frame (syntax element raw_data_block()), as
   described in section 4.4.2.1 of [ISO14496-3:2009].

4.5.  For object header media type = Video H265 in HVCC (0x04)

   Payload MUST be H.265/HEVC with bitstream HVC1 format as described
   in [ISO14496-15] section 8.3.  Using 4 bytes size field length,
   as indicated by lengthSizeMinusOne = 3 in the
   HEVCDecoderConfigurationRecord.

   Each payload contains one or more HEVC NAL units prefixed with a
   4-byte length field.  The NAL unit types follow [ISO23008-2]:

   - IDR_W_RADL (19), IDR_N_LP (20): Instantaneous Decode Refresh
   - CRA_NUT (21): Clean Random Access
   - TRAIL_N (0), TRAIL_R (1): Trailing pictures
   - TSA_N (2), TSA_R (3): Temporal Sub-layer Access
   - STSA_N (4), STSA_R (5): Step-wise Temporal Sub-layer Access
   - BLA_W_LP (16), BLA_W_RADL (17), BLA_N_LP (18): Broken Link Access

Extension Summary (red5-moq-pkgr additions)

   The following table summarizes all header extension types, including
   the HEVC additions:

   +===============+============================+======================+
   | Extension ID  | Name                       | Value Format         |
   +===============+============================+======================+
   |  0x0A (even)  | Media Type                 | Varint               |
   +---------------+----------------------------+----------------------+
   |  0x0D (odd)   | H264 Extradata (AVCC)      | Byte array (length)  |
   +---------------+----------------------------+----------------------+
   |  0x0F (odd)   | Opus Audio Data            | Byte array (length)  |
   +---------------+----------------------------+----------------------+
   |  0x11 (odd)   | UTF-8 Text                 | Byte array (length)  |
   +---------------+----------------------------+----------------------+
   |  0x13 (odd)   | AAC-LC Audio Data          | Byte array (length)  |
   +---------------+----------------------------+----------------------+
   |  0x15 (odd)   | H264 Metadata (AVCC)       | Byte array (length)  |
   +---------------+----------------------------+----------------------+
   |  0x17 (odd)   | H265 Metadata (HVCC)       | Byte array (length)  |
   +---------------+----------------------------+----------------------+
   |  0x19 (odd)   | H265 Extradata (HVCC)      | Byte array (length)  |
   +---------------+----------------------------+----------------------+

   Even extension IDs carry a varint value directly.
   Odd extension IDs carry a varint length followed by that many bytes.
